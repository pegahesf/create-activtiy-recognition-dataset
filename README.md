# create-activtiy-recognition-dataset
AR_DATASET Nowadays smartphones have a noticeable presence in different aspects of our lives. The processing power, communication bandwidth, and the memory capacity of these devices have surged considerably in recent years. Besides, the variety of sensor types, such as an accelerometer, gyroscope, humidity sensor, and bio-sensors, which are embedded in these devices, opens a new area of self-monitoring the physical daily activities. One of the primary steps for any research in the area of detecting daily life activities is to test a detection method on the benchmarked datasets. By using this Project ,You can easily create your own dataset for mobile activity recognition using Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. just You need to change the Connection string Address.This app,get Sensors Data.then,Then, the data is segmented in the group of 10 non-overlapping instances and passed to the next step to extract the features in an offline way.Also, you can create arff file from your data and create learning model online.It is worth mentioning you can use this app for two mobile positions hand and thigh for 7 activities such as: Sitting,Standing,Cycling,walking,Running,Stairs up and down. for more informatoin please for more information visit https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320922327_PAMS_A_new_position-aware_multi-sensor_dataset_for_human_activity_recognition_using_smartphones
